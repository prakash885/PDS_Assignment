This dataset contains student performance data, including test scores in math, reading, and writing, along with demographic information such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental education level, and lunch status. It also includes details on whether students completed a test preparation course. The dataset categorizes gender as male or female, and race/ethnicity into anonymized groups (Group A, B, etc.). Parental education levels range from high school to masterâ€™s degree, while lunch status indicates if students received standard or free/reduced lunches. Scores for math, reading, and writing are recorded on a scale of 0 to 100, and the dataset also notes whether students completed a test preparation course. This data can be used to analyze how these various factors affect student performance across different subjects.
